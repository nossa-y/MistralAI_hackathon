What our solution does&nbsp;:  
We aim at streamlining the patent search process by leveraging advanced AI technology. More specifically, leveraging on Mistral AI LLMs and LangChain for Agentic RAG with Control flow.

As it happens, our knowledge base of patent was in French, so we leveraged the multilingual capacity of `mistral-large` to dialog with it from interactions in English.

How it looks in the wild&nbsp;:
